# LÖVEstrafe

A top-down 2D tech demo of Quake-based strafe jumping physics using the LÖVE engine.

Currently supports VQ3 and CPM physics models according to the Quake2/QuakeWorld source codes.

This project has been shelved and will remain a tech demo until further notice. The latest build is fully functional and can be found in the releases section.
